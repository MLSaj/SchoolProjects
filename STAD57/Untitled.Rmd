This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Simulate two sequences of 1,000 observatins from the two models
AR(2) model : Xt= -.4Xt-1 + .4Xt-2 + Wt, Wt-iid N(0,1)

MA(2) model = Yt = Vt +.5Vt-1 +.2Vt-2 Vt - iid N(0,1)
where Yt is independent of Wt. Create the product series Zt=Xt*Yt. Create time series
plots&ACF of X,Y,Z
```{r}
W = rnorm(n=1000, mean=0, sd=1)
X=filter(W,c(-0.4,0.4),method ="recursive")
V= rnorm(n=1000,mean=0,sd=1)
Y= filter(V,c(1,0.5,0.2),sides=1)
Z=X*Y

plot(X,main="TS X"); acf(X,main="ACF X")
plot(Y,main="TS Y"); acf(Y, na.action = na.pass,main ="ACF Y")
plot(Z,main="TS Z"); acf(Z,na.action = na.pass, main = "ACF Z")
```

Load the "monthly milk production" data set into R using the following code
```{r}


```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
